Following codes are used as column names of 

* subject - Test subject, from 1 to 30.
* activity - Activity determined from sensor data.
    - WALKING
    - WALKING_UPSTAIRS
    - WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
    - SITTING
    - STANDING
    - LAYING

Data column features are measured in the time domain, denoted as following words:

* body_acceleration - Body acceleration signals.
* gravity_acceleration - Gravity acceleratino siganls.
* body_gyro - Gyroscope signals.
* fourier - Signals converted into frequency domain with Fast Fourier Transform.

Directions:

* 3-axis are denoted as X, Y, and Z.

Signal types:

* jerk - Jerk signals derived in time from linear acceleratino and angular velocity.
* magnitude - Magnitude is calculated using Euclidean norm from 3 axis.

Following values are provided:

* mean - Mean of measurement
* std - Standard deviation of measurement.
